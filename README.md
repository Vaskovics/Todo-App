# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App repository! This project showcases a web application built with TypeScript and React. It allows users to create, edit, and delete todos. The application interacts with a server using the Fetch API, enabling the saving and retrieval of todos. Users can also filter todos based on their completion status, mark all todos as active, delete all completed todos, and view the number of active todos remaining.
